Q129: A file numbers.txt contains a list of integers separated by spaces. Read all integers, compute their sum and average, and print both.

/*
Sample Test Cases:
Input 1:
File: numbers.txt (Content: 10 20 30 40 50)
Output 1:
Sum = 150
Average = 30.00

*/
  #include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fp;
    int num, sum = 0, count = 0;
    double average;

    // Open the file in read mode
    fp = fopen("numbers.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Could not open file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read integers until end of file
    while (fscanf(fp, "%d", &num) == 1) {
        sum += num;
        count++;
    }

    fclose(fp);
